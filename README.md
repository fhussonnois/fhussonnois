### Hi, I'm Florian 👋

I’m a passionate open-source advocate for a long time, currently working as Lead Software Engineer at [Kestra](https://kestra.io/). 

I worked for 12 years as a Software Engineer, Consultant, and Trainer specializing in stream processing architectures.

Throughout my career, I’ve helped organizations build robust data streaming platforms and event-driven products, particularly leveraging Apache Kafka. 

As a long-time contributor to the open-source community, I’ve co-organized the [Paris Apache Kafka Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Paris-Apache-Kafka-Meetup/) for several years and frequently speak on Kafka-related topics. 

My contributions include some Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) for Kafka Streams, as well as the creation of open-source projects like Connect FilePulse and Jikkou.

For my work in the community, I was recognized as part of the [Confluent Community Catalyst](https://www.confluent.io/nominate/) program from 2019 to 2024.

Here are some projects, I'm currently working on 💻 : 
 - [Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra)
 - [Jikkou](https://github.com/streamthoughts/jikkou)
 - [Azkarra Streams](https://www.azkarrastreams.io/)
 - [Connect File Pulse](https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse)
 - [Kafka Clients Kotlin](https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-clients-kotlin)
 - [Kafka Streams CEP](https://github.com/fhussonnois/kafkastreams-cep)
